# StSModEnergizedSpire

This is a content mod for Slay the Spire that adds a lot of new **Energy relics** to the boss relic pool!
 
Every single relic added by this mod adds 1 Energy at the start of your turn and has a negative effect similar to how base game Energy relics work.

Currently there are 15 new relics developed: 2 for each base character, and 9 relics for all characters. More relics will be added continually.
